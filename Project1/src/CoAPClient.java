/**
 * In the first programming project you will create a client program that can talk to an IoT server (for example a sensor) via CoAP. 
 * The program should be able to discover available information on the IoT server, retrieve data from the IoT server, 
 * and push data to the IoT server. Hence, you will need to create a program that can correctly connect to a CoAP server, 
 * to then send, recive, and interpret CoAP messages.
 * 
 * Your CoAP client need to minimally support the following commands, and then display the responses 
 * from the CoAP server just like a real CoAP client.
    POST
    The program should be able to send POST messages to send data to sensors/actuators with a short path names.

    PUT
    The program should be able to send PUT messages to send data to sensors/actuators with a short path names.

    GET
    The program should be able to send GET messages to retrieve data from sensors/actuators with a short path names. 
    (You don't need to implement block transfer)

    DELETE
    The program should be able to send DELETE messages to remove data from sensors/actuators with a short path names.
